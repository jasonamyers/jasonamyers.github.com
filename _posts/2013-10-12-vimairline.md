I have been wanting to do a vim/python series of screencasts for a while;
however, I've always put it off.  Nonetheless, I recorded a quick video on
[vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline), and how I have it
configured.  I hope you enjoy it, and feel free to drop me any suggestions you
might have about it.
