I broke my 2013 goals down into two parts last year, and I thought I'd go
through them and review where I stood. So up first the personal goals:

* __11/12/13 Plan (Top Secret)__ - Perhaps the worst kept secret, but I was able to
marry the love of my life, Denise, on this day. There are so many reason why it
took so long, but I couldn't be happier.
* __Get down to >17% Body Fat__ - So this didn't happen, while I did keep over 100
pounds of weight off, my disciple faultered after my Mother passed away;
however, I am back on losing track again.
* __Save 10% of my income__ - Nope got married
* __Spend less time driving__ - This didn't change, and I'm beyond sad about it.
A confluence of factors prevented it from happening this year, but it's gonna
happen soon.
* __Buy only one computer__ - I will end this year without even owning a nonwork
computer, also very sad about that.
* __Buy no other technology__ - I got a phone :(

Only one a couple of successes, but I'm pleased with the outcomes.  The 11/12/13
was the most imporant out of the batch and I accomplished it.  And for me ending
the year and only having bought a phone is a huge feat, but still broke the goal
:(

Okay, On to the professional side:

* __Develop GluTrends into a fully functional product__ - Renamed it to Sucratrend,
and while it's not getting the traction I had hoped, it's a great tool.
* __Become more proficient with Python__ - I think this is progressing, and will
always be an ongoing goal. I believe my code is better tested, more idiomatic,
and less buggy than one year ago. So I'm gonna say I passed this one.
* __Contribute to one open source Python library__ - I made contributions to Django
and ResWeb and py-setproctitle. It no where near what I had hoped, but it's a
start.
* __Speak at a Python conference__ - I was able via a ton of luck to be able to
speak at PyOhio
* __Blog regularly and have something to say__ - FAILED

So on a professional front I think I did quite well.  A ton of guidance and
encouragement from my coworkers and the rest of the python and nashville
development communities made this part seem to fly by.

Okay so on to 2014 Goals:

## Personal:

* Move Closer to Work
* Save 10% of my income
* Buy only one computer and tablet, no other technology

## Professional:

* Make PyTN the best conference it can be
* Become better at testing
* Become better at doing things the Django way when in Django
* Contribute more to Django and OpenStack
* Blog More
* Speak at two python conferences
