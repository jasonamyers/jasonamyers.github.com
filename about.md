## Software Developer
Iâ€™m looking for a software engineer position where I can continue developing my
skills and contributing to the community. I really find open source and
community work fulfilling as it has the potential to move everyone forward.
I switched to software engineering full time a few years ago after spending
several years building datacenters and cloud architectures for large clients.
However, even during those years I often used my software development skills to
solve problems and develop monitoring solutions. I love solving human problems,
and I have a side project, [Sucratrend](https://www.stratasan.com), devoted to helping diabetics manage their
I work every day at [Stratasan](http://www.stratasan.com) developing health care analytics, and
I also organize the [PyTennessee Conference](http://www.pytennessee.org).
