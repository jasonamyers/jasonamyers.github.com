## Software Developer
Solving real human problems is my primary focus as a developer.  As a diabetic,
I understand the daily struggle of living with a chronic condition, and I'm
working hard to develop a way to manage our condition that is usable regardless
of the socio-economic factors of the person using it.  Without a need for
accounts and interacting with my fellow users in contexts that are available and
understandable to them, [Sucratrend](http://www.sucratrend.com) is my life's work
personified. I work every day at [Stratasan](http://www.stratasan.com) developing health care analytics, and
I also organize the [PyTennessee Conference](http://www.pytennessee.org).
